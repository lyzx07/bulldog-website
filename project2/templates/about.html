          About Northwest American Bulldogs - Portland, Oregon
        </h1>

      <p class="about-text">
        &nbsp &nbsp We are a family in Hillsboro, Oregon that has been raising
        purebred NKC registered <b>American Bulldogs</b> for past 10 years. Our
        passion for these dogs became our preferred past time and our focus has
        been to raise healthy, strong, confident, and social puppies that make
        perfect members of the family. We have had several litters throughout
        the years, and we keep in contact with most of the families who have
        purchased a puppy through us. We love receiving photos, videos, and
        updates on all our puppies.<br /><br />
        &nbsp &nbsp We commit to providing healthy puppies to our clients and so
        we have had our dogs genetically health tested to help ensure healthy
        litters. We always get health exams for the puppies, deworm them, and
        vaccinate them before they go home to their forever families. Even with
        these precautions, if an unforeseen health issue comes up within the
        first year, we will take any puppy back in exchange for another pup. We
        feed our dogs a diet of ground raw meat (beef, lamb, chicken), carrots,
        apples, and other veggies. We do introduce our puppies to soggy Pedigree
        dog food at 4 weeks and then some dry food by 6 weeks so that they will
        be used to a dog food diet if that is what you choose to do. They will
        also receive the raw food diet.
